Real-Time Emotion Detection

Description

This project implements a real-time facial emotion detection system using Deep Learning and OpenCV. It detects emotions from a live webcam feed and classifies them into one of the following categories:

-Angry 😠
-Disgust 🤢
-Fear 😨
-Happy 😃
-Neutral 😐
-Sad 😢
-Surprise 😲

The model is trained on the FER2013 dataset using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and can be further fine-tuned using ResNet50 for improved accuracy.
